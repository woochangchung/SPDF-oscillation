The model Hamiltonian includes a Heisenberg ferromagnetic term, an external magnetic field, and a second-order single-ion anisotropy. The magnetic properties of the system are treated by the random phase approximation for the exchange interaction term and the Anderson–Callen approximation for the anisotropy term. Our paramagnetic results are in agreement with the other theoretical results."

	abstract = {Quantum mechanical superexchange interactions form the basis of quantum magnetism in strongly correlated electronic media. We report on the direct measurement of superexchange interactions with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. After preparing a spin-mixture of ultracold atoms in an antiferromagnetically ordered state, we measured coherent superexchange-mediated spin dynamics with coupling energies from 5 hertz up to 1 kilohertz. By dynamically modifying the potential bias between neighboring lattice sites, the magnitude and sign of the superexchange interaction can be controlled, thus allowing the system to be switched between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin interactions. We compare our findings to predictions of a two-site Bose-Hubbard model and find very good agreement, but are also able to identify corrections that can be explained by the inclusion of direct nearest-neighbor interactions.},
